# GHW Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for a personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website showcases projects, skills, and contact information, and was created during GHW: Beginners in January 2026.

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the portfolio website.
2. Customize the content by editing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files as needed.
3. Deploy the website using any web hosting service or platform of your choice – in the tutorial, we will be using GitHub Pages.
